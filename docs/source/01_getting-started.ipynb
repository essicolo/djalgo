    "# 1. Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways of using Djalgo: in the browser without worrying to install anything or in a Python environment for better speed and access to its AI capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. In the browser\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Djalgo in the browser, head to a notebook suporting Pyodide, a Python interpreter that runs in the browser. Pyodide doesn't run in the cloud, it's really your browser that is compiling code. Head to [marimo.new](https://marimo.new) - [Jupyter lite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) isn't supported yet ([issue](https://github.com/essicolo/djalgo/issues/4)). If you are new to programming, I highly recommand Marimo as it takes care of installing packages on import. Then use Djalgo as you intend, maybe following the tutorials with copy and paste. Since Pyodide might shut down everything when you close the tab, take care to save-as or copy-paste your code to recover your work later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. In a Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommandation to start with Python is to [install `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). It allows to manage your Python worflow like a boss. Once you have `uv` installed, use it to download the latest version of Python and create a new environment. In a terminal,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "uv python install 3.12\n",
    "cd my_project\n",
    "uv python pin cpython@3.12\n",
    "uv init .\n",
    "uv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uv python install 3.12` downloads and installs the latest version of Python 3.12\n",
    "- `cd my_project` changes the directory to a new folder named `my_project`\n",
    "- `uv python pin cpython@3.12` tells `uv` to use Python 3.12 for this folder\n",
    "- `uv init .` initializes the current folder as a Python project\n",
    "- `uv venv` creates a virtual environment in the folder\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, activate the virtual environment and install Djalgo. In the terminal, for Linux and MacOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",

    "``` \n",
    ".venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",

    "Then, install Djalgo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "uv add djalgo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to install some other packages to use Djalgo to its full potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `uv add marimo` or `uv add jupyterlab` to interact with your code in a notebook\n",
    "- Musecore and `uv add music21` to use musical Python objects\n",
    "- `uv add pretty-midi` to fine-tune and export your music to midi objects\n",
    "- `uv add scamp` to play music with sound fonts right from your notebook\n",
    "- Djalgo's AI being based on PyTorch, so you will need to `uv add torch` to train an AI on your music\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Djalgo comes with its a music player and a score renderer, you might want to install Musecore if you really need it. I'm showing how here, but you mostly won't need it. Once Musescore is installed, you will have to tell Python where it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows: there are several ways to install MuseScore, explore to find the correct path if it doesn't work.\n",
    "```\n",
    "from music21 import environment\n",
    "environment.set(\"musescoreDirectPNGPath\", \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\MuseScore 4\\\\bin\\\\MuseScore.exe\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- macOS\n",
    "```\n",
    "from music21 import environment\n",
    "environment.set(\"musescoreDirectPNGPath\", \"/Applications/MuseScore 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linux: the command will likely work if MuseScore is installed on the system, not from a flatpak, a snap or an appimage.\n",
    "```\n",
    "from music21 import environment\n",
    "environment.set(\"musescoreDirectPNGPath\", \"/usr/bin/musecore\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 1.3 Leveraging Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not my favorite approach, platforms like [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can run your code in the cloud from a notebook-style interface. Bear in mind, though, that free plans generally come with service-specific limitations. While processor and RAM limitations won't hinder simple music composition methods, more advanced techniques like [machine learning-based ones](api.html#djalgo.djai.DjFlow) could experience a slower workflow. In any case, opening your pockets to a service you love can be rewarding, or course for your service provider, but also for you. To install Djalgo in a cloud environment, just run\n",

    "Djalgo offera a range of functionalities designed for music composers and enthusiasts. Here’s a snapshot of what Djalgo brings to the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **music player** in `player.py` to listen and record to your creations.\n",
    "- A **score renderer** in `score.py` to visualize your music in a score.\n",
    "- **Analysis**: Located in `analysis.py`, discover a suite of indices for dissecting tracks—whether it’s pitches, durations, or offsets. These metrics serve not just for analysis but also as benchmarks for the evolutionary algorithms found in `genetic.py`.\n",
    "- **Conversion**: `conversion.py` is your gateway to integrating Djalgo with popular music packages. Transform notes and compositions into formats compatible with Music21 for notation, Pretty-Midi for MIDI refinements, and SCAMP for sound production. Installing these packages is a prerequisite for conversion.\n",
    "- **Fractals**: `fractal.py` delves into the beauty of mathematics, extracting music from the intricate patterns of cellular automata and Mandelbrot fractals.\n",
    "- **Genetic Algorithms**: Use `genetic.py` to evolve your music, steering it towards specific analytical targets defined in `analysis.py`.\n",
    "- **Harmony**: `harmony.py` equips you with tools to enrich compositions with scales, voicings, and ornamental touches.\n",
    "- **Loop Visualization**: `loop.py` helps visualize musical loops with radar plots, offering a new dimension to beat creation.\n",
    "- **Minimalism**: Explore minimalist techniques in `minimalism.py`, from additive and subtractive processes to Arvo Pärt’s tintinnabuli, and craft music with a minimalist ethos.\n",
    "- **Rhythm**: The `Rhythm` class in `rhythm.py` is designed for crafting and experimenting with complex rhythmic structures.\n",
    "- **Utilities**: `utils.py` provides essential tools for fine-tuning: repair, tune, and quantize your compositions to perfection.\n",
    "- **Random and Kernel Walks**: In `walk.py`, let music wander through algorithmic paths, guided by random and kernel-induced walks.\n",
    "- **Machine learning**: DJai is a work in progress, and does not behave as expected. `djai.py` is  aimed at using machine learning to generate new music pieces, all powered by TensorFlow. DJai was designed to learn from any MIDI file, but if *art* your aim, you'd better create a machine that learns from your own compositions. "
