The `weights` quantify the importance of the index in the computation of (pitch, duration, offset) notes. Usually, you'll want weights to be zero in offsets. The `targets` argument specifies the values the evolution should be going toward. If the weight of the offsets are zero, the value of the corresponding target won't matter. These values can be modulated at will, but you could as well avoiding defining them and keep with the reasonable values encoded in Djalgo.
