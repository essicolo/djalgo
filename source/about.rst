About
=====

My name is **Essi Parent**, the creator behind **Djalgo**, a toolkit designed to intertwine math and music composition. I'm standing at the convergence of diverse fields, blending contemplative creativity, empathetic innovation, and analytical rigor to navigate the complexities of both life sciences and technology.

My journey is one of perpetual learning and discovery, bridging disparate domains to forge new paths and understandings. With a foundation in **ecological engineering, agriculture, and data science**, my work aim at leveraging scientific insights to tackle global challenges. I'm also an **algorithmic musician**, delving into the symbiosis between technology and art to craft soundscapes that mirror the intricate dance between analytical thought and expressive nuance.

I created Djalgo to explore how algorithms can shape emotional soundscapes. Djalgo is a commitment to blending science with art, showcasing the beauty and complexity of the world through the language of music.
